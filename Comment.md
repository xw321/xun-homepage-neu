## Comments on Project 1.

* Great example for me to follow and I enjoyed browsing your homepage.
* The web page looks fancy and well organized. The theme is clear with various styles of content.
* The format of the code is easy to read and the annotations help me to read the code better.

Just a little advice that there are three empty headings in the hobby.html file on line 70, 85 and 100.

In all, good job. Cheers!
